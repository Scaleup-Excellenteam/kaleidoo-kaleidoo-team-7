## **Project Overview**

This project is a multi-functional Python application consisting of several independent but interconnected modules. It provides functionality for:

- Loading and processing data
- Audio transcription using a custom pipeline
- Managing data through a database manager
- Parsing and processing documents for key insights

Each module is designed to handle specific tasks, making it easier to maintain and expand the system for different use cases like natural language processing, database operations, and multimedia handling.

## **Modules**

### **1. app.py**
This is the main entry point for the application. It integrates all modules and orchestrates the workflow across different tasks like data loading, audio transcription, and document parsing.

### **2. AudioTranscription.py**
Responsible for handling audio input and converting it into text. The module likely includes a transcription pipeline that uses speech-to-text algorithms.

**Main features:**
- Audio input handling
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Error handling for transcription process

### **3. data_loader.py**
Manages data loading from various sources and formats, ensuring that the data is clean and ready for further processing by other modules.

**Main features:**
- Data import from CSV, JSON, and other formats
- Data validation
- Preprocessing tasks

### **4. DatabaseManager.py**
Handles the communication with the underlying database, offering methods to insert, update, delete, and query data.

**Main features:**
- Database connection management
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- SQL queries or NoSQL operations

### **5. DocumentsParser.py**
Processes and parses documents, possibly using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract key information or perform text analysis.

**Main features:**
- Document parsing
- Text extraction and preprocessing
- NLP tasks like tokenization and entity recognition

### **6. TextProcessor.py**
Focuses on various text processing functions such as cleaning, tokenizing, and applying machine learning models for text analysis.

**Main features:**
- Text normalization and tokenization
- Applying ML models to text
- Feature extraction for text classification
